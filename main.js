/*
    1. People can register a new hot air balloon to race. Heâ€™ll need the name of the driver,
            and the total volume of the balloon as registration info.
    2. All registered balloons must be stored in a list that he can reference at any time.
    3. Each balloon must use his hot air filling service. Hot air is pumped into each balloon
            at 5 cubic feet per run of the engine which is 2 minutes. Keep a log as each balloon is filled.
    4. When the race starts each balloon will move westward at a random pace between 10-50 ft/second
        Check every 5 minutes to check the current random wind speed
    5. As soon as a balloon has moved 10000 ft westward, that balloon wins and will be announced
